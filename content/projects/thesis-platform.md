# Project Goal

This project serves as a platform to facilitate the creation, management, and viewing of academic proposals. The system allows users to create new proposals, view proposal details, manage feedback, and update proposal statuses. It categorizes proposals based on their topic area and differentiates between student and supervisor roles, ensuring a clear and organized workflow.

The motivation behind this project is to offer academic institutions an efficient mechanism to simplify the proposal submission, evaluation, and feedback cycles, thereby facilitating a smoother pairing of students with their respective supervisors.
