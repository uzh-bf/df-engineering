# Goal

KlickerUZH is a web application that supports the interaction between lecturers and their audience in various ways. In a KlickerUZH live quiz (e.g., during a lecture), a speaker may pose questions to be answered by participants over their devices. If so desired by the speaker, the audience may ask questions to which the lecturer can leave a response from within the tool (Live Q&A). KlickerUZH further supports asynchronous interactions (i.e., outside of class) like microlearning and practice quizzes, as well as collaborative activities (e.g., group activity).
