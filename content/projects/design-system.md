title: Design System
---
# Goal

The design system simplifies the shared use of commonly used components in our web-development projects with corporate colors already included. It is based on [[react-js]] components using https://www.radix-ui.com and [[tailwind-css]] and is optimized for usage within [[next-js]]. Future extensions of the design system will also support [[web-components]].
