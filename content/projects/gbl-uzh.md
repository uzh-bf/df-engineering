# Goal

Game-based learning has many benefits for lecturers and students. However, it can be difficult to get started with developing learning games and integrating games with other curricular activities. We want to foster the application of game-based learning in the university context by providing foundational resources for game usage and development based on what we have learned on our own journey.
