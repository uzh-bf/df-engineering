# Goal

The EscapeUZH platform is a web-based tool that facilitates the creation of digital (educational) escape rooms. It is based on the Escapp platform ([github.com/uzh-bf/escapp](https://github.com/uzh-bf/escapp)) developed initially at Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid and adapted and hosted by the Department of Banking and Finance for the University of Zurich.

You can find more information in our use case ([EscapeUZH - Developing Digital Educational Escape Rooms](https://www.gbl.uzh.ch/use-cases/escape-uzh/)) and in the details of our own escape room ([EscapeUZH - The Search for the Instant University Diploma](https://www.gbl.uzh.ch/games/escape-uzh/)).
