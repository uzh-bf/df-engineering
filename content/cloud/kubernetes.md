# What is Kubernetes (K8s)?

> Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It allows users to group containers into logical units for easy management and discovery, and is based on principles that enable it to scale applications without increasing the operations team significantly. Kubernetes provides features like automated rollouts and rollbacks, service discovery and load balancing, storage orchestration, self-healing, secret and configuration management, automatic bin packing, batch execution, horizontal scaling, and IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack support. It is designed for extensibility and can be run on-premises, hybrid, or public cloud infrastructures.
