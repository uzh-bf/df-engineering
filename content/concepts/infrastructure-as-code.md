# What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?
> Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a method of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. The concept is similar to how software developers write code to manage the behavior of a computer program; in IaC, scripts are written to automatically manage and provision the infrastructure.
> 
> Here are some key points about IaC:
> 
> - **Automation:** IaC automates the provisioning of infrastructure, making the process faster, more repeatable, and less prone to human error.
> - **Version Control:** Infrastructure code can be version-controlled, allowing changes to be tracked and audited, and enabling collaboration among team members.
> - **Consistency:** By codifying environments, teams can ensure consistency across development, testing, and production environments.
> - **Idempotency:** IaC configurations are typically idempotent, meaning they can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application, ensuring reliable and predictable infrastructure state.
> 
> Tools like [[terraform]], [[pulumi]], AWS CloudFormation, Ansible, Puppet, and Chef are commonly used for implementing Infrastructure as Code.
