# What is SecretOps / Secrets Management?

> Secrets management is the process of securely handling and protecting sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, encryption keys, and access tokens that are used in computer systems and applications. This involves securely storing, managing, and accessing these secrets to prevent unauthorized use and minimize security risks. It includes practices like dynamic secret generation, encryption, access control, secret rotation, and auditing to ensure that sensitive data is only accessible to authorized entities and remains protected both at rest and in transit.
