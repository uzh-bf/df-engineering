# What is Figma?

> Figma is a cloud-based design tool that enables users to collaborate on designing, prototyping, and creating design systems. It offers real-time collaboration for teams, allowing designers to work together in the same file simultaneously. Figma also includes features for creating interactive prototypes and a new Dev Mode to assist developers in translating designs into code. Additionally, it supports design systems with shared libraries for reusable assets and components. FigJam, part of the Figma ecosystem, is an online whiteboard for team collaboration on product planning and brainstorming sessions.
