# What is Quartz?

> Quartz, as described in the text, is a fast, batteries-included static site generator that transforms Markdown content into fully functional websites. It offers a range of features like Obsidian compatibility, full-text search, graph view, wikilinks, backlinks, Latex support, syntax highlighting, popover previews, and Docker support. It's designed for creating personal notes, websites, and digital gardens easily publishable to the web. Quartz seems to be highly customizable and extendable through plugins and supports hot-reload for content and configuration changes.
