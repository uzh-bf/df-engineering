# What is Obsidian?

> Obsidian is a private and flexible writing app designed for note-taking and knowledge management. It allows users to store notes on their own devices for quick offline access, organize thoughts with a variety of plugins and themes, and visualize connections between notes using graphs and canvas views. Obsidian supports linking ideas within a personal knowledge base, akin to creating a personal Wikipedia. It offers features like version history, sync with AES-256 encryption for multi-device access, collaboration tools, and the ability to publish notes as an online wiki or digital garden. The app is free for personal use and offers additional paid features for advanced use cases.
