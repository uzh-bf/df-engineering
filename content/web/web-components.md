# What are Web Components?

> Web Components are a set of web platform APIs that allow developers to create custom, reusable, encapsulated HTML tags for use in web pages and web apps. They are based on four main specifications:
>
> 1. **Custom Elements**: This allows developers to define their own custom HTML elements along with their behavior.
> 2. **Shadow DOM**: Enables encapsulation of the style and markup, creating a shadow boundary that keeps the internals separate from other code on the page.
> 3. **HTML Templates (`<template>` and `<slot>` elements)**: The `<template>` element is used for declaring fragments of HTML that can be cloned and inserted in the document by script. `<slot>` elements are placeholders inside your component that users can fill with their own markup.
> 4. **ES Modules**: The standard for reusing JavaScript modules in the browser, allowing developers to import and export functionality from modules.
