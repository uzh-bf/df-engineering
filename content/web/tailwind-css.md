# What is TailwindCSS?

> Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of low-level utility classes that can be composed to build any design directly in your markup. It allows you to create custom designs with ease and provides tools for responsive design, state variants, and dark mode, among other features. Tailwind CSS emphasizes constraint-based development, enabling you to work within the constraints of a system and maintain consistency in your designs. It also offers performance benefits by automatically removing unused CSS when building for production.
