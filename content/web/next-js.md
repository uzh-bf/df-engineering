# What is Next.js?

> Next.js is a React framework that enables developers to build full-stack web applications by extending React's latest features. It integrates powerful Rust-based JavaScript tooling for very fast builds. Some key features include:
>
> - **Built-in Optimizations**: Automatic optimizations for images, fonts, and scripts to improve user experience and Core Web Vitals.
> - **Data Fetching**: Supports both server-side and client-side data fetching, allowing React components to fetch data asynchronously.
> - **Node.js & Edge Runtimes**: Enables scalable serverless functions and fast delivery of dynamic, personalized content.
> - **Advanced Routing & Nested Layouts**: File system-based routing with support for complex routing patterns and UI layouts.
> - **Dynamic HTML Streaming**: Streams UI from the server to the client, integrated with React Suspense.
> - **CSS Support**: Compatibility with various CSS tools like CSS Modules, Sass, Tailwind CSS, and styled-jsx.
> - **Route Handlers**: Creation of API endpoints to interact with third-party services.
> - **Middleware**: Control over incoming requests to define routing and access rules for authentication and other purposes.
> - **React Server Components**: Use server components to reduce the amount of JavaScript sent to the client.
> - **Client & Server Rendering**: Flexible rendering options on a per-page level, including Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR).
