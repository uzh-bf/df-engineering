# What are Actionable Messages?

> Actionable Messages are interactive notifications within Outlook (or other Microsoft Products) that allow users to take actions directly from an email or a notification, without leaving Outlook. These actions could include filling out a survey, approving an expense report, updating a CRM sales opportunity, or adding a comment to a Trello card. They are designed to improve productivity by enabling users to perform tasks within the context of their inbox or Office 365 Groups. Developers can embed these actions in their emails or notifications, which are represented as cards within the message that provide details and offer action buttons for the user to interact with.
