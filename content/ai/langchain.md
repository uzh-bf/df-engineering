> **LangChain** is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It enables applications that:
>
> - **Are context-aware**: connect a language model to sources of context (prompt instructions, few shot examples, content to ground its response in, etc.)
> - **Reason**: rely on a language model to reason (about how to answer based on provided context, what actions to take, etc.)
