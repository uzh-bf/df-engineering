# What is Github Actions?

> GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows directly in your GitHub repository. You can create custom workflows to build, test, and deploy your code based on a variety of triggers like pushing to a branch, creating a pull request, or on a scheduled basis. It supports a range of programming languages and frameworks, and integrates with various tools and cloud services.
