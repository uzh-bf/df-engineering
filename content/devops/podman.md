# What is Podman?

> Podman is an open-source, daemonless container engine that is designed to develop, manage, and run OCI (Open Container Initiative) containers and pods on your Linux system directly. It allows users to run containers without requiring a container daemon, unlike Docker which relies on a daemon, thus enhancing security and performance. Podman also supports rootless containers, which means it can run containers without root privileges, further increasing security. Additionally, Podman is compatible with Docker containers and can manage Kubernetes pods, images, and containers. It integrates with various tools and platforms, provides a command-line interface (CLI), and even offers a desktop application for managing containers across different environments.
