# What is Terraform?

> Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool created by HashiCorp. It enables users to define and provision a datacenter infrastructure using a declarative configuration language known as HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), or optionally JSON. Terraform manages external resources (such as public cloud infrastructure, private cloud infrastructure, network appliances, software as a service, and platform as a service) with "providers".
>
> Terraform codifies cloud APIs into declarative configuration files. This allows a user to create, manage, and update infrastructure resources such as physical machines, VMs, network switches, containers, and more. Users can apply versioning to these files, re-use modules, and share them across teams.
