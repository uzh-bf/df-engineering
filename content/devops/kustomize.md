# What is Kustomize?

> Kustomize is a tool designed to customize Kubernetes manifests. It allows users to modify, add, or remove configurations within these manifests without the need for forking (creating a separate codebase). Kustomize can be used as a standalone binary or as an integrated feature within `kubectl`, the command-line interface for running commands against Kubernetes clusters. It provides a purely declarative approach to configuration customization, which means that all changes are expressed in a way that describes the desired state without scripting the steps to achieve that state. Kustomize works by using plain YAML files that can be easily validated and processed. It supports managing multiple customized Kubernetes configurations and encourages a workflow where users can fork (copy), modify, and rebase (update with changes from the original source) their configurations.
