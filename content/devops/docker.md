# What is Docker?

> Docker is a platform that provides a suite of development tools, services, trusted content, and automations to accelerate the delivery of secure applications. It allows developers to build, share, and run applications in containers, which are lightweight, stand-alone, executable packages that include everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime environment, libraries, and system settings. Docker is used by developers for its ease of creating consistent environments across different stages of development and deployment.
